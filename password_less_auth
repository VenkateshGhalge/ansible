# password less 
We will create the ssh key on the master node  using ssh-keygen it will generate 3 file 
 - authorizaed_key: A file storing the public keys
 - id_rsa.pub: the public key 
 - id_rsa: the private key 
 
 we create the ssh on managed node 

we will copy the public key from master node to managed node using below command 

 on master node 

 cd ~/.ssh/
 cat id_rsa.pub

 on target node 

 vi ~/.ssh/authorized_key 

then you can try to login using ssh 

ssh user@ip_address

we can create the new user on target host like ansible give the sudo access by ending the sudoers file in /etc folder, if you want to use sudo password less  then we need to add the below line 

ansible  ALL(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWS:ALL

we have to add the pub key from the master node to targeted node for ansible user 

cat LOCAL/PATH/my-ssh.pub | ssh root@my.host.com \
"sudo -u ansible bash -c 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh; chmod 700 ~/.ssh; tee -a ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'"

now we can try to connect to the server using 

ssh user@ip_address
